# country-coder

📍 ➡️ 🇩🇰 Convert longitude-latitude pairs to ISO 3166-1 codes quickly and locally


## What is it?

`country-coder` is a lightweight package that looks up identifiers for geographic points without calling a server. It can also convert between alpha-2, alpha-3, numeric-3, and Wikidata identifiers.

#### Advantages

Client-side coding has a number of benefits over server-side solutions:

- ✅ 🚅 *Performance*: get fast, reliable results at scale
- ✅ ✌️ *Ease of Use*: forget async callbacks, network errors, API keys, and rate limits
- ✅ 🕶 *Privacy*: keep your location data on-device
- ✅ 📴 *Offline Workflows*: deploy to connection-challenged environments

#### Caveats

`country-coder` prioritizes package size and lookup speed over precision. Thus, it's **not** suitable for some situations and use cases:

- 🚫 🛂 *Disputed Borders*: only one country is returned per point, the "de facto controlling country"
- 🚫 🚢 *Maritime Borders*: only points on land are supported; borders over water are highly generalized
- 🚫 🖋 *Complex Borders*: land borders are of varying detail and may be imprecise at granular scales
- 🚫 🧩 *Country Subdivisions*: provinces and similar features under ISO 3166-2 cannot be coded
- 🚫 📇 *Naming*: feature names are not included; you can get them with another package or the Wikidata API
- 🚫 📐 *Spatial Operations*: a feature's calculated area, bounding box, etc. will likely be inaccurate
- 🚫 🗺 *Mapmaking*: the border data is not intended for rendering


## Installing
